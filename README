# Dual-core CPU script

# https://github.com/remcoros/sensation-dual-core-patch
# 
# Current behaviour:
# - first check for existence of /system/etc/virtuous_oc/wake_max_freq
#   if found, asume oc daemon found and exit.
#
# when awake:
#  - if we wake from earlier sleep, set cpu0 to the remembered cpu0 frequency
#  - sets cpu1 online with scaling_max_freq same as cpu0
#
# when sleeping:
#  - remember current cpu0 frequency
#  - sets cpu1 offline
#
# To enable debugging (log to /devlog/dual_core):
#  echo 1 > /system/etc/dual_core/debug
# 
# based on original script by mike1986
# heavily mod by remcoros
#
# 1.1: fix issue with cpu1 always set to boot frequency (not always the same as current cpu0)
# 1.0: Standalone patch on github
# 0.8: cpu1 governor lock
# 0.7: detect oc daemon, reformat code, writable settings/log, better handle awake when 3rd party sets frequencies, extensive logging (when enabled)
# 0.6: rewrite
# 0.5: mike1986's script
